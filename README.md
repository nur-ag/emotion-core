# Emotion Core: An Open Source Framework for Emotion Detection Research

This project contains a snapshot of the two sub-projects composing Emotion Core: Emotion Classification and EmotionUI. The snapshot acts as a fully reproducible cell submitted for publication at Software Impacts, an Elsevier journal. For details and updates, please refer to the two projects separately:

* [Emotion Classification](https://github.com/nur-ag/emotion-classification): a Python project containing software tools to train, evaluate and deploy machine learning models for emotion detection.
* [EmotionUI](https://github.com/nur-ag/emotion-ui): a JavaScript project containing a single-page web application to showcase and explore emotion detection models trained with the Emotion Classification programs.

Additional information about the related publications, as well as the public EmotionUI interface showcasing research artifacts (Emotion Detection models) can be found in the [public EmotionUI](http://emotionui.nur.systems).
